### Hello forks!
Hello folks!

My name is Cẩm, but my non-vietnamese friends usually call me Jack, as they found the Vietnamese pronunciation of my name is just horribly difficult, like any Vietnamese names else.

I am a die-hard fan of [Chelsea FC](http://chelseafc.com), and the coach, Jóse Mourinho, has been my lifelong idol.

I am an enthusiastic and passionate back-end developer, based in Saigon, Vietnam. Currently focused on big data, distributed computing and functional programming.

Right now I am working as Lead Software Engineer at [Dadadee](https://dadadee.com), a trusted community marketplace for people to list, buy or sell goods and services online in bulk, by tapping on crowd-buying and reverse-auction, where I spend everyday observing NewRelic Dashboard, mining Ruby gems and fixing bugs. Yeah of course, I build features too!

Chinese history intrigues me especially the character, Cao Cao, albeit he was considered unrighteous!

In my spare time, I enjoy reading on Chinese history and programming, playing PES and contributing articles to the Ruby Community. 

Let end this with a quote which I try to live by,

> You must be shapeless, formless, like water. When you pour water in a cup, it becomes the cup. When you pour water in a bottle, it becomes the bottle. When you pour water in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Water can drip and it can crash. Be water my friend! - Bruce Lee
