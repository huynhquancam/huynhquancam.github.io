### Hello forks!

My name is Cẩm, but my foreign friends usually call me Jack, as they found the Vietnamese pronouciation of my name is just ...
horribly difficult! (in fact all Vietnamese names are!)

I am a die-hard fan of [Chelsea FC](http://chelseafc.com) since 2000, and its coach, Jóse Mourinho, has been my lifelong idol.

I am an enthusiastic and passionate developer (hmmm, I was told to say so), based in Saigon, Vietnam!
Although I am comfortable to work as a full-stack developer (from front-end to back-end), as a Javascript hater,
currently my learnings are mainly focused on big data, distributed computing and functional programming.

Right now I am working as Lead Software Engineer at [Dadadee](https://dadadee.com), a trusted community marketplace for people to list,
buy or sell goods and services online in bulk, by tapping on crowd-buying and reverse-auction,
where I spend everyday observing NewRelic Dashboard, mining [Ruby gems](https://www.ruby-lang.org) and fixing bugs. Yeah of course, I build features too!

I love to read books about history and programming and [Cao Cao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cao_Cao) is the historical character I like the most,
albeit he was considered unrighteous! When I am free, I enjoy listening to C-pop (especially Jay Chou), playing PES, and writing essays.

One of my favorite quote from Bruce Lee.

> You must be shapeless, formless, like water. When you pour water in a cup, it becomes the cup. When you pour water in a bottle, it becomes the bottle. When you pour water in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Water can drip and it can crash. Be water my friend!

Still feel curious about me? Check my [resume]({{'/rbcv' | prepend: site.baseurl }}),
and my [blog](http://kipalog.com/users/hqc/mypage) out, or drop me an [email](mailto: cam@hqc.me).
