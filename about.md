### Hello forks!

My name is Cẩm (or Cam if you feel it better to pronounce my name in this way), a Vietnamese developer working in Gothenburg, Sweden.

I graduated from Ho Chi Minh University of Industry, major in Computer Science.

I am a die-hard fan of [Chelsea FC](http://chelseafc.com), and the coach, Jóse Mourinho, has been my lifelong idol.

Right now I am working as a Backend Engineer at [Football Addicts](https://footballaddicts.com), the home of [Forza Football](http://www.footballaddicts.com/apps/).

Chinese history intrigues me especially the character, Cao Cao, albeit he was considered unrighteous!

In my spare time, I enjoy reading on Chinese history and programming, playing PES and contributing articles to the Ruby Community. 

Let end this with a quote which I try to live by,

> You must be shapeless, formless, like water. When you pour water in a cup, it becomes the cup. When you pour water in a bottle, it becomes the bottle. When you pour water in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Water can drip and it can crash. Be water my friend! - Bruce Lee
